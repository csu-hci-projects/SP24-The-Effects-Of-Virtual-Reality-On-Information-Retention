------TO RUN THE PROJECT----- \
GOOGLE DRIVE LINK TO PROJECT EXE DOWNLOAD: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tPnPduVJxchzwnDTy-gxY8Q20LOQG0Lr?usp=sharing 

 - This link is to the folder to the download to run the project. Alternatively, the entire Unity project can be downloaded from our GitHub. 
    - To run the project, download this folder, unzip the downloaded folder, and then run the VR Room.exe file. 
    - The project has been tested on a Steam Valve Index VR Headset. It should work for other headsets, but we were unable to test other headsets. 
    - A VR headset and controllers are required to run this program. The setup might have to be different for other headsets. Steam VR will start along with the exe IF using a Steam Valve Index. 
    - Other headsets might have other settings required that we cannot test. 
    - If on a Valve Index VR headset, the controls are: 
        - Push Joycon left or right to rotate the player, additionally rotating your head follows as well. 
        - To teleport to the spinning reticle coming from your hand: close your grip and press the trigger. 
    - On other headsets, the controls might be mapped differently.
